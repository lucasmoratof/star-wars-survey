# star-wars-survey
Guided project as part of Dataquest Data Analyst in Python course.<br>
In this project I have done:
- Practice few of the basic tool from pandas for analysis; 
- Created some plots after converting str to float;
- Tried to answer few questions with the data I'd manipulated.

Contributions are more than welcome. We are here to learn :)
